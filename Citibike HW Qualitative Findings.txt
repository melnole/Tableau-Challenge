For the dataset, i used Jersey City for Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 due to the large amount of data available, i had to
cut down somewhere.

Summaries by Tab:

Females by Month tab:
There was an implication in the HW Readme that there was an initiative to get more female ridership.
This chart shows that female ridership declined in volume over certain months, share of female ridership
has remained stable. This is positive news in that there is no loss, however, there is no growth either.

Monthly Change tab:
There was an increase in ridership for January vs December. 
Though I don't have the analysis to support my theory, 
I'd imagine that volume of riders was down in December since most people take off
multiple days or even weeks during this time of year. Since the busiest 
start station is at a PATH, my assumption is that the bulk of people from the station
generating the most starts are communters to work. Therefore, people taking vacation
for the holidays from work caused a decline in December and therefore an increase in
January vs December as things got back to normal.

Short term v annual tab:
I'm not certain if COVID could have an effect on subscriber type but we see an
increase in share of customers in the month of March. This could be people who are 
no longer allowed to go to the office, and or have been furloughed and using the bikes
in a more leisurely manner as opposed to using for commuting.

Number of Riders and Trip Duration tabs:
Although number of riders has decreased, trip duration has increased, supporting a theory
in the previous tab about the journey type changing from commuter to leisurely, possibly
as an effect of COVID (furloughs or otherwise).

Basic map tab:
The Grove Street PATH station is not surprisingly, the station most often used as a start 
station for citibikes. This is expected, as PATH is a major transportation hub which commuters
 would arrive at, then rent and take a citibike to their respective places of employment or otherwise.
